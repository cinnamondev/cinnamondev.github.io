                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        Initial idea: CM4 carrier connected to a screen in a GBA SP shell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Issues with initial idea:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thin dimensions, not much room to work with for cooling/batties/etc..</li>
                            <li>Smaller dimenions meant only smaller batteries (~2000mAh) could be used.</li>
                            <li>Relatively high power consumption of CM4 meant this may mean issues with short (&lt;1h) battery life </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New idea: CM4 carrier connected to a screen in a custom, 3d printed shell. Screen is on a slider mechanism to reveal gamepad/accessory pad. Magnets used to lock screen in desired positions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Issues with new idea
                        <ul>
                            <li>It will be thicker :(</li>
                        </ul>
                        Pros with new idea
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complete control on port placement, button placement, etc...</li>
                            <li>Additional room for cooling (passive heatsinks, etc)</li>
                            <li>Bigger battery (big plus)</li>
                        </ul>
                        Current additional ideas:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strike>Seperate gamepad board into seperate daughter board communicating with main board, allows for customisable design based on current bos</strike> Impractical fn!</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Design - Prototype casings</h2>
                    <p>
                        (Images of previous casing designs, with issues and changes. There were some different minor revisions between that do not need mentioning.)
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Initial design featured dovetail slides in the plastic, with very little tolerance, meaning lots of post processing was required in order to get any sort of functionality.</p> 
                            <p> No tracks on the edge were made either, allowing for the head 'screen' unit to move side-to-side along the fixed post, causing it to catch, preventing the sliding of the 2 parts</p> 
                            <p>The positioning in the initial state of the cable entry point on the screen would've also meant that the ribbon cable connecting the screen to the mainboard would be allowed to catch/pinch when in a closed state, causing potentially damage over time.</p>                       
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>(No bottom part was printed in this revision).<br>Major changes: Additional thickness added to screen to accomodate real display (DFRobot DFR0550). New entry point for ribbon cable</p>
                            <p>Part was not developed past this due to some issues with the lower screw holes printing incorrectly, insufficent distance for the counterbored screw hole without the hole collapsing somewhat.</p>
                            <p>Parts were also still, too high tolerances (screen needs additional room to prevent ribbon being pinched, magnet diameter too exact to accomodate tolerances in manufacturing...</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>This revision was a major redesign. Most parts were remade with new tolerances in mind and the additional side tracks were added to stop the screen moving side-to-side and catching. Screen fits in this one! Bottom part was also printed in this revision.</p>
                            <p>Major issues found later: The screen cable is still likely to be stressed due to the bends it has to take to connect to the main board, and as it slides it will be frequently bent in many directions. In the next revision this should be accomodated for. The screen brightness control is also hard to access (small hole)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Semi-redesigned... ish. The part was resized to accomodate for battery choices and new parts (bottom of the base component) has now been designed. An adaptor board has been designed to prevent stress on the cable in the screen component (see above), which will hopefully prevent most stress situations.</p>
                            <p>This one is to be printed (ran out of PLA :( )</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Newest design (from 11/04/22) will reflect component placement decisions. Some parts like the cable will be in slightly different positions to accomodate the place on the PCB preventing stress by creating bends etc...</p>
                        </li>

                    <h3>1. Part choices</h3>
                    <p>A lot of components seem to be out of stock or backordered, so part choices were limited. See Figure 1. for basic block diagram</p>
                    <h3>2. Building the schematic</h3>
                    <p>This is the first project I'm designing using professional EDA software, and I had some to learn before making the second revision of the board (first revision was for GBASP Shell).
                        I found between revisions reading on some advice on PCB design was helpful. <a href="http://alternatezone.com/electronics/files/PCBDesignTutorialRevA.pdf">David L. Jone's 'PCB Design' document</a> was particularly helpful.
                        Using this, I stuck to a 50thou grid in my schematic, and carrying forward 50/100thou grids when it comes to PCB design.
