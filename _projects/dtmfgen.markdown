For my Electronics A-Level, we were tasked to design 2 electronic systems of our own choice and design.

The second project I designed was a DTMF (Dual Tone Modulation Frequency) tone generator.

DTMF is often seen in telecommunication systems, everything from phones to intercom systems. This is done entirely through a combination of analogue and digital
circuitry to generate each frequency and modulate them at the output based on demand.

The inspiration used for this project was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ym8WNvxxUk), where someone was able to feed DTMF tones through a speaker into an intercom system, allowing the person entry to the building. This is an example of physical penetration testing, a crucial skill in the modern world. See the corresponding [writeup](https://github.com/breaktoprotect/CVE-2017-16778-Intercom-DTMF-Injection/) on the exploit in afforementioned video for more.

(Source unavailable due to data loss that happened before the project would've been put onto Github, apologies.)
