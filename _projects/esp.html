    As part of the Embedded Systems Project course, as a group, we must undertake
    designing an autonomous vehicle (line follower robot). This requires strong
    team-working skills and a combination of skills in hardware and software design (C/C++), 
    as well as learning and using the skills required to manage a group of people and responsibly manage
    resources.

    Within this project, my role revolves primarily around the software component of the buggy, though this comprimises a larger scope as this requires
    intimate knowledge and research of the microcontrollers we will use in order to design software that is maintainable, as well as fast and taking full
    advantage of the hardware available.

    Throughout the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester, our buggy will be tested in a variety of challenges. We aim to build the fastest buggy possible so that we can
    participate in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF3jng65Hf4" target="_blank">final race</a> (goes to an external website), where the fastest and best documented buggies will be eligible for prizes., sponsored by InstMC.
