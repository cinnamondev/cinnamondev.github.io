<p>
    For my Electronics A-Level, we were tasked to design 2 electronic systems of our own choice and design.
</p>
<p>
    The second project I designed was a DTMF (Dual Tone Modulation Frequency) tone generator.
</p>
<p>
    DTMF is often seen in telecommunication systems, everything from phones to intercom systems. This is done entirely through a combination of analogue and digital
    circuitry to generate each frequency and modulate them at the output based on demand.
</p>
<p>
    The inspiration used for this project was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ym8WNvxxUk" target="_blank" class="noLink nav">this video</a>, where 
    someone was able to feed DTMF tones through a speaker into an intercom system, allowing the person entry to the building. This is an example of physical 
    penetration testing, a crucial skill in the modern world. See the corresponding 
    <a href="https://github.com/breaktoprotect/CVE-2017-16778-Intercom-DTMF-Injection/" target="_blank" class="noLink nav">writeup</a> on the exploit in 
    afforementioned video for more.
