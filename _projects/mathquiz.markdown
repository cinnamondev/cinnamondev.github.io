As part of the A-Level Computer Science course, we were tasked with both the design and development of a program of our own choice.
This required us to determine all factors, such as the demand for such a program, intended target audience. From this, we could determine a set of software requirements and use case diagrams.

I chose to design an automatic quiz generator program, intended to help primary and early secondary school students learn the basics of mathematics.

The result of this is a system designed within the C# (.NET) ecosystem and the corresponding Windows Presentation Framework.

It is capable of quizzing students on everything from basic addition to solving quadratics, as well as basic user management, along with a tiered permission system and administration tools that could be used to check student progress.

(Source unavailable due to data loss that happened before the project would've been put onto Github, apologies.)
