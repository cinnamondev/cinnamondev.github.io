This project aspires to create a handheld games console, powered by a
Compute Module 4 (equivalent to a Raspberry Pi 4, with board-board connectors that
break out the IO of the RPi). This was chosen for its performance and software support
from the Pi Foundation.

Due to shortages, this project has ended up being left 'on-hold', despite all larger
components being fully designed (PCB, casing) Revisions to parts of the design are being
made when free time is found for it, such as to prototype a new sliding mechanism for thw
screen, using a 3D printed spring to provide feedback and require additional force to oprate.

Update (December '23): A redesign of part of the project may be due, with the release o
a compute module 5 being due in '24, despite persisting (though slowly alleviating) shortages.

I hope to design a lot of parts of this project, regardless, using my improved CAD and PCB
design skills to use. With component shortages being somewhat less severe, we may also be able
to redesign parts of the project to use different components entirely - and make the design
more compact and overall better. Should try to put active cooling somewhere, and we can
change the dimensions of the project to allow for batteries to be relocated to the sides rather
than under everything else. This will also provide an area for grips and potentially new button
placement a lot alike newer products with a similar form factor.

Note: Youtube **shouldn't** be collecting any data unless the video is played.
