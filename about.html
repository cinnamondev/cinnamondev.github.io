                <p>
                    Hi! I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student at the University of Manchester- studying Electrical Engineering, with a
                    keen interest in Digital System Design. Over time in education, I have transitioned from software oriented projects
                    and studying CS + related both at GCSE and A-Levels, to taking a particular interest in Electronics at A-Levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently study Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Manchester (MEng, expected 2027, Year in Industry).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to browse my projects below. These are projects from different points in my studies & personal work thus far. Some work's source
                    may not be available or may not be currently available- this may be because the work is part of an ongoing course or the original source may
                    be lost (i.e: some older pieces of coursework from GCSE/A-Level). Feel free to browse my

                        This project aspires to create a handheld games console, powered by a
                        Compute Module 4 (equivalent to a Raspberry Pi 4, with board-board connectors that
                        break out the IO of the RPi). This was chosen for its performance and software support
                        from the Pi Foundation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to shortages, this project has ended up being left 'on-hold', despite all larger
                        components being fully designed (PCB, casing) Revisions to parts of the design are being 
                        made when free time is found for it, such as to prototype a new sliding mechanism for the 
                        screen, using a 3D printed spring to provide feedback and require additional force to operate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Update (December '23): A redesign of part of the project may be due, with the release of
                        a compute module 5 being due in '24, despite persisting (though slowly alleviating) shortages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope to design a lot of parts of this project, regardless, using my improved CAD and PCB
                        design skills to use. With component shortages being somewhat less severe, we may also be able
                        to redesign parts of the project to use different components entirely - and make the design
                        more compact and overall better. Should try to put active cooling somewhere, and we can
                        change the dimensions of the project to allow for batteries to be relocated to the sides rather
                        than under everything else. This will also provide an area for grips and potentially new button
                        placement a lot alike newer products with a similar form factor.

                        As part of the Embedded Systems Project course, as a group, we must undertake
                        designing an autonomous vehicle (line follower robot). This requires strong
                        team-working skills and a combination of skills in hardware and software design (C/C++), 
                        as well as learning and using the skills required to manage a group of people and responsibly manage
                        resources.

                    <p>
                        Within this project, my role revolves primarily around the software component of the buggy, though this comprimises a larger scope as this requires
                        intimate knowledge and research of the microcontrollers we will use in order to design software that is maintainable, as well as fast and taking full
                        advantage of the hardware available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester, our buggy will be tested in a variety of challenges. We aim to build the fastest buggy possible so that we can
                        participate in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF3jng65Hf4" target="_blank">final race</a> (goes to an external website), where the fastest and best documented buggies will be eligible for prizes., sponsored by InstMC.

                        For my Electronics A-Level, we were tasked to design 2 electronic systems of our own choice and design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For our first electronic system, I designed a guessing game using a PIC16F88. The task of the game is to 
                        guess a randomly selected number. Once a number is guessed, the game will indicate using LEDs if you won or lost, and if so, 
                        by more or less. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RNG is only pseudo-random, as there is a limitation on available sources of 'randomness'. So, instead, we constantly increment a value while waiting for a button press.
                        Whatever this value is when the button is pressed becomes that particular digit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Input to the system is done by a 4x3 keypad matrix, which is scanned repeatedly while waiting for an input. 
                        All code was written in MPASM assembly. This lets us take advantage of the hardware, as we are particularly strained for resources on such a microcontroller.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Further: DTMF Generator Coursework</h4>
                    <p>
                        The second project I designed was a DTMF (Dual Tone Modulation Frequency) tone generator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DTMF is often seen in telecommunication systems, everything from phones to intercom systems. This is done entirely through a combination of analogue and digital
                        circuitry to generate each frequency and modulate them at the output based on demand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inspiration used for this project was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ym8WNvxxUk" target="_blank" class="noLink nav">this video</a>, where 
                        someone was able to feed DTMF tones through a speaker into an intercom system, allowing the person entry to the building. This is an example of physical 
                        penetration testing, a crucial skill in the modern world. See the corresponding 
                        <a href="https://github.com/breaktoprotect/CVE-2017-16778-Intercom-DTMF-Injection/" target="_blank" class="noLink nav">writeup</a> on the exploit in 
                        afforementioned video for more.

                    <h3>(OLD) Math Quizzer Coursework</h3>
                    <p>
                        As part of the A-Level Computer Science course, we were tasked with both the design and development of a program of our own choice. 
                        This required us to determine all factors, such as the demand for such a program, intended target audience. From this, we could determine
                        a set of software requirements and use case diagrams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I chose to design an automatic quiz generator program, intended to help primary and early secondary school students learn the basics of mathematics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result of this is a system designed within the C# (.NET) ecosystem and the corresponding Windows Presentation Framework. 
                        It is capable of quizzing students on everything from basic addition to solving quadratics, as well as basic user management, 
                        along with a tiered permission system and administration tools that could be used to check student progress.
