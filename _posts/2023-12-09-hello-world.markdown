I have succesfully converted to jekyll, with a new blog page to tag along!
Hopefully, this blog will be filled with interesting project thoughts, opinions, etcetera.

Major changes to the frontcode have been made to make the site more manageable, and break it down into smaller components that are less tied to eachother. This is helpful where we will be re-using elements across pages.

The website has also been updated to use the single consistent style  (404), as well as some bug-fixes.

Check out the code [here](https://github.com/cinnamondev/cinnamondev.github.io)!
